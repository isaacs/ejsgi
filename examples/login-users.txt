Holy MOLY this is insecure, don't ever use something this stupid in
production!

In reality, this should be in a database or something, and not in clear text.
To do this right -- AT LEAST -- the passwords should be sha1 encrypted.
Narwhal has a sha1 module, or you could check out jssha.sourceforge.net.

Storing passwords in the clear, anywhere, is 100% Doing It Wrong.  Also, I'm
doing a string === comparison, and I'm guessing that JavaScript is only
testing until it finds a non-matching byte, meaning that an attacker could
just pick a password and keep firing password attempts at it and detect how
long it takes to fail.

In other words, don't copy this, it's for demo only.

You've been warned.

The first thing is the username, the second is the password.  Any line not
matching is ignored.

foo:bar
asdf:quux
admin:!@#$%^&*()
user:pass
